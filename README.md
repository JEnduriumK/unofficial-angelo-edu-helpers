# unofficial-angelo-edu-helpers
Unofficial Angelo State University projects that might help in a CS course or three.

Projects here do not promise to function in any way. 

If you get a zero on a project after using one of these tools, that's on you, not the project.

If you have helper code/functions/scripts that you've found useful in assignments, try sending us the code?

You might find that this main branch shows all the tools. Hopefully there is a separate branch for each tool, so you only need to check out the tool(s) you need?
